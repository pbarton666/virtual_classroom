This repo contains Docker configurations to virtual programming courses.

dkr_conda_3.9 produces a conda-based Python 3.9 data science stack built from the
included requirements.txt, a Jupyter notebook server, and course files linked to
a git repo.   The container can be accesed via a bash terminal for command line
access or via a local browser.

dkr-py310 produces a Python 3.10 partial data science stack using a release candidate
for 3.10, numpy, and Jupyter. Many other libraries like scipy and pandas are not yet
compatible (as of 20 April 2021).

The images should "just work" with minor configurations on the students' machines.
They'll need to:
    - install Docker Desktop
    - if on Windows, allow permission via Docker Desktop to access their directories
    - set up directories on their machines to contain course folders
    - access course files with the editor of their choice.
